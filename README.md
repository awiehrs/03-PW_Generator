Homework - Week 3: Password Generator

## Description

The objective of this assigment was to create a functional password generator using JavaScript so an employeee could choose a strong password to provide greater security to their sensitive data.

I was provided with the starter HTML and CSS to build a functional user interface with JavaScript. 

The user should begin by clicking the Generate Password button, to which a prompt will show up at the top of the browser. The prompt then instructs the user to choose criteria to base the password off of. The user will choose how long the password should be, if they want upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. 
If the user does not follow the instructions and chooses outside of 8 and 128 characters, the generator will not run and it asks the user to try again. If the user does not pick any criteria, the generator will not run.
Once the criteria are selected, the final prompt will close and the user will see a randomly generated password using the criteria selected in the center dialogue box.
